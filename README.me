this is a hash table written in C based on sha1 hashing


it works by using the sha1 hash for addressing the data you want to store inside the hashtable
i encode 4bit of each byte in the 20 bytes of the sha1 as 16 pointers list over 40 pointers for each pointer
in such way that uses the 20 byte hash address
